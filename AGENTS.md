# AGENTS instructions

- Run `pytest -q` after making changes. The repository currently has no tests; the command should succeed with "no tests ran".
- Avoid automatic reformatting with tools like `black` or `isort` unless explicitly required for a change.
- Keep documentation files under `docs/` in German.
- Use concise English commit messages summarizing the change.
